I always have a to-do list—every time I check something off, another task appears. I’ve tried planners and countless apps, but I either work FIFO (oldest first), chase easy wins to shrink the list, or waste hours setting up systems that are too hard to maintain. No matter how much I finish, I still end the day unsure I spent time on the right things.
Talking with peers who felt the same sparked a different approach: an app that ranks tasks by my judgment through simple pairwise choices. Instead of agonizing over a full ordered list, I just answer, “Which is higher priority: A or B?” The app repeats this down the list to produce a clear priority order. From there, I get a practical to-do view where I can check items off and easily add or modify tasks. It’s lightweight, human-driven prioritization that helps me focus on what actually matters—without the overhead of yet another complicated system.
