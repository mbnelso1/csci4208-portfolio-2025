I will publish a ranking snapshot to JSONBin containing type, app_version, snapshot_id, created_at/updated_at, an items list (each task has id, title, rank, done, updated_at), and light meta (task_count, engine). I create the bin once, then PUT to /v3/bins/{BIN_ID} for each new snapshot and GET /v3/bins/{BIN_ID}/latest to read it; writes use Content-Type: application/json and X-Master-Key, while reads are public. Client-side reconciliation is last-write-wins: de-dup tasks by id using the newest updated_at, normalize ranks to 1..N, and prefer the snapshot with the newest top-level updated_at. On publish, build from local state, apply the merge, PUT, and show “Saved”; on read, show loading/empty/error with a retry.
