Lab 4 required us to create a hi-lo game using HTML, JavaScript, DOM and events. Using Dom and events allowed me to update the page based on user interactions, as well as select elements and attach event listeners. This lab also taught us about the value in separating model, view and controller. I enjoyed the game, but found it challenging when the time constraint was added. In the future, I think it would be interesting to add or subtract time based on how close your guess is getting.
