Lab 6 tasked us with creating a trivia game using the Fetch API. We used the Fetch API to implement a REST client and we used JS modules to organize the code base. There were three options we had to consider when judging a players status: a correct answer, a wrong answer, and the answer being submitted within the required time frame. Along with these considerations, we had to keep track of multiple players' scores.
